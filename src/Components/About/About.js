            <div className="1stpart">Every engineer cherishes the 3idiots' infamous remark "ALL IZZ WELL," which is close to our heart. TEXAVISION gives a heart full of fun and merriment in the midst of all the assignments, deadlines, vivas, and practicals. Over the course of three extended days, we celebrate our togetherness, discover our hidden talents, and just live life to the fullest.</div>
            <div className="2ndpart">Fun-filled activities and stellar performances are sure to captivate you until the very end. The most anticipated event of all is Texawalk, GCETTS's own fashion walk, which is followed by a stunning band performance by Bohurupi, enthralling dances, one mic stand, and numerous other activities. Star studded nights are always mesmerising. This year TEXAVISION is all set to take you into a world of its own.</div>
